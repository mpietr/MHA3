# Mr. Hedgehog Adventures 3: Tomato Crisis in Kotlin
A simple game I coded to take further a joke that my friends and I made.
Aside from being a programming language, Kotlin is also a village in Greater Poland Voivodeship, known for its ketchup industry.
Hence the tomatoes. So it's a Kotlin-Kotlin game. Very funny, I know.

You control the hedgehog by tilting your phone. The objective of the game is to gather all 30 tomatoes without hitting a rock.
